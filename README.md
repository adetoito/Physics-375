# Physics 375: Experimental Physics III - Electromagnetic Waves, Optics and Modern Physics

A repository containing programs & scripts used in my optics lab. Data collection and error analysis is done using MATLAB and Python.

## Lab 0: MATLAB and LabJack Programming
This experiment introduced me to MATLAB and its use with data collection in tandem with LabJack.

#### `rand_script(N)`
A simple function that operates on a uniformly distributed continuous random variable on the interval [0, 1].
The argument N specifies how many numbers within the interval to generate and store in an array.

Output is an array containing the mean and uncertainty on the mean of the N-sized array.
The mean and uncertainty are also printed out.
